  "description": "The ChatterBot system is structured around three core components: the `Storage Adapters`, `Training Module`, and `Corpus Data Loader`. The `Corpus Data Loader` is responsible for providing raw conversational data, which is then consumed by the `Training Module`. The `Training Module` processes this data to learn and update the chatbot's knowledge base, persisting and retrieving conversational statements through the `Storage Adapters`. This design ensures a clear separation of concerns, allowing for flexible data storage and diverse training methodologies.",
